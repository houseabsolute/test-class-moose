Revision history for Perl distribution Test-Class-Moose

0.55 2014-03-18
        * There are a number of deprecations and backwards incompatible
          changes in this release!
        * Calling runtests() on Test::Class::Moose or a subclass of that class
          is now deprecated. Use the new Test::Class::Moose::Runner class
          instead.
        * The Test::Class::Moose::Role::Parallel role no longer does
          anything. You can use the Test::Class::Moose::Runner class to run
          tests in parallel by passing a jobs parameter to its
          constructor. See the docs for details.
        * Parallel testing is now done _per test class instance_ rather than
          per method. In other words, each subprocess instantiates a test
          class and runs all of its test methods.
        * You can now run multiple instances of a test class by using the
          Test::Class::Moose::Role::ParameterizedInstances role. See the
          Test::Class::Moose docs for details.
        - All private methods defined as lexically-scoped variables in
          Test::Class::Moose have been made actual methods so that roles and
          subclasses can affect them.
        - Removed MooseX::ClassAttribute from the list of prereqs in
          Makefile.PL. Test::Class::Moose loaded this but never used it.

0.54 2014-03-18
        - Update the tutorial for typos and to documents Tests()
        - Add the github.io homepage.

0.53 2014-03-15
        - Loooong day. The ContributorsFromGit dist::zilla plugin did, indeed,
          add all git contributors to the POD, but it deleted all of my other
          POD. This might be my record for number of rereleases in a day.

0.52 2014-03-15
        - Note in the docs the Sub::Attribute change from version 0.51
        - Oops. Remove all of the .bak files from the distro.
        - List contributors automatically in docs

0.51 2014-03-15
        - Sub::Attribute is now required and not optional.
        - Added a Makefile.PL to the dzil distro so people can more easily
          contribute.

0.50 2014-03-14
        - :Test and :Tests attributes have been added.
        - TAP::Stream is now in its own distribution and thus removed from
          this one.
        - Test::Class::Moose::Role - croak() if preamble doesn't load
          (Sebastian Willert)

0.43 2014-01-29
        - When running parallel tests, we now output a line of dots to the
          screen to show that the test suite hasn't stalled. Further, the dots
          are colored "green" and "red" (sorry color blind folk!) just like
          Test::Harness, so you can see if tests have passed or failed.

0.42 2014-01-15
        - Remove experimental END block causing issues for some test suites.
        - Merge Dave Rolsky's MetaJSON request (thanks, Dave!)
        - Add better github meta info
        - Document recommended test suite instantiation.
        - Document what Test::Class::Moose::Role is for.

0.41 2014-01-13
        - Fix bug where "skip_all" tests would report as failing if
          Sub::Attribute wasn't installed.

0.40 2014-01-12
        - Parallel tests now automatically ignore test methods tagged with
          'noparallel'.
        - Fix bug where sequential tests fail with parallel testing.
        - Remove long-deprecated test_reporting() method.
        - The second argument to test methods ($report) is now deprecated.
          Call $test->test_report instead.
        - You can now call has_tag() on a method report object.

0.30 [unreleased]
        - Experimental support for parallel testing. See
          Test::Class::Moose::Role::Parallel.

0.22 2013-08-17
        - Renamed tutorial from .pod to .pm to stop both cpan and metacpan
          from replacing main documentation with the tutorial.

0.21 2013-08-15
        - Fold on .t test into t/tags.t. Cleaner and stops some CPAN testers
          failures.

0.20 2013-08-15
        - Fix bug #87801 where excluded tags were ANDed instead of ORed.
          Stefan Corneliu Petrea.
        - The beginnings of a tutorial by Doug Bell (preaction)
        - Doc fix by Olaf Alders.
        - Tag inheritance added by Paul Boyd (see
          https://github.com/Ovid/test-class-moose/pull/10). This change is
          slightly backwards-incompatible, but not many people were yet using
          this module (or tags).

0.12 2013-05-27
        - Bugfix: test_classes attribute to constructor is allowed to be
          undef or an empty array ref.
        - add_to_plan() is now deprecated. Use plan() instead. This solves the
          problem where you might also have a before modifier wanting to alter
          the plan.

0.11 2013-05-19
        - Added the test_classes attribute to the contructor. Allows you to
          easily control which classes you wish to run.

0.10 2013-05-08
        - Sigh. Skip All tag tests if we can't define tags.

0.09 2013-05-07
        - Emergency bug fix: don't require Sub::Attribute if they cannot load
          it.

0.08 2013-05-06
        - Add tag support.
        - Clean up how start and end times for timing is handled.

0.07 2013-04-07
        - The $test_suite object now has the time() method.
        - Fully document report methods
        - Marked a bunch of "trusted" methods as effectively private.
        - Rename tests_run() to num_tests_run() (internal consistency)
        - Rename test_reporting() to test_report() (test_reporting() is now
          deprecated)
        - Rename ::Reporting classes to ::Report
        - Allow plans in methods. See #84046 in RT queue (Steffen W)
        - Convert to Dist::Zilla
        - Runtests returns $self.

0.06 2013-03-17
        - Fix the MANIFEST again. That's it. After this I'm switching to
          Dist::Zilla.

0.05 2013-03-17
        - Even if attributes start with test_, they cannot be test methods.
        - Add AutoUse to the MANIFEST :/

0.04 2013-03-17
        - Fix test inheritance bug.

0.03 2013-03-16
        - Add Test::Class::Moose::Role::AutoUse (automatically loads your
          actual classes)

0.02 2013-01-29
        - Add class/method skipping. 
        - Rename almost every overrideable method to /^test_/.
        - Add a time reporting class. You can now fetch real, user and system
          time for each class or test method.
        - Fix for errors when no test methods found (they should be skipped -
          beresfordt)
        - Don't use a bare qw() for parens (reported on github by beresfordt)
        - Make sure we have hi-res time reporting
        - Move statistics gathering into its own classes
        - Add include/exclude test method filtering
        - Skip a test class if we don't find any test methods
        - Most attributes pushed into Test::Class::Moose::Config
        - Added "randomize" attribute per Udo Oji.

0.01 2012-12-18
        - Test::Class + Moose
