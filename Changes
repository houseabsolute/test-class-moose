Revision history for Perl distribution Test-Class-Moose

{{$NEXT}}
        * Added a randomize_classes attribute which can be passed to
          Test::Class::Moose::Runner. Implemented by Andy Jack. GitHub PR #53.
        * Test::Class::Moose::Role now enables strict and warnings in the
          caller just like Test::Class::Moose does. GitHub PR #54.

0.60 2015-07-06
        * Doc updates including fixing the bug reporting link and making sure
          the CONTRIBUTORS section is up to date.

0.59 2015-07-06
        * Allow _constructor_parameter_sets to return an empty
          list. Implemented by Philipp Gortan. (GitHub issue #47)
        * Error messages when Test::Class::Moose::Load cannot load a module
          now include stack traces. (GitHub issue #43)

0.58 2014-09-05
        * Add a passed() method to class and method report objects (GitHub issue #30)
        * If a test class did not run (such as an abstract class), the time()
          method on reports now returns a zero duration time instead of
          undef (GitHub issue #34)

0.57 2014-09-02
        * Fix the homepage link in the meta info.

0.56 2014-09-02
        * This is the first release to include the deprecations and backwards
          incompatibilities from 0.55. Please see that release's notes as
          well!
        * Skip parallel tests on Windows. This may be a bug in
          Test::Class::Moose or Parallel::ForkManager, but for now we're
          punting. Reported by Alexandr Ciornii. GitHub issue #36.
        * Removed Sub::Attribute from the "recommends" list. This is required
          now, and listing it as both required and recommends is confusing.
        * Lots of doc fixes.

0.55 2014-03-18
        * There are a number of deprecations and backwards incompatible
          changes in this release!
        * Calling runtests() on Test::Class::Moose or a subclass of that class
          is now deprecated. Use the new Test::Class::Moose::Runner class
          instead.
        * The Test::Class::Moose::Role::Parallel role no longer does
          anything. You can use the Test::Class::Moose::Runner class to run
          tests in parallel by passing a jobs parameter to its
          constructor. See the docs for details.
        * Parallel testing is now done _per test class instance_ rather than
          per method. In other words, each subprocess instantiates a test
          class and runs all of its test methods.
        * You can now run multiple instances of a test class by using the
          Test::Class::Moose::Role::ParameterizedInstances role. See the
          Test::Class::Moose docs for details.
        * All private methods defined as lexically-scoped variables in
          Test::Class::Moose have been made actual methods so that roles and
          subclasses can affect them.
        * Removed MooseX::ClassAttribute from the list of prereqs in
          Makefile.PL. Test::Class::Moose loaded this but never used it.

0.54 2014-03-18
        * Update the tutorial for typos and to documents Tests()
        * Add the github.io homepage.

0.53 2014-03-15
        * Loooong day. The ContributorsFromGit dist::zilla plugin did, indeed,
          add all git contributors to the POD, but it deleted all of my other
          POD. This might be my record for number of rereleases in a day.

0.52 2014-03-15
        * Note in the docs the Sub::Attribute change from version 0.51
        * Oops. Remove all of the .bak files from the distro.
        * List contributors automatically in docs

0.51 2014-03-15
        * Sub::Attribute is now required and not optional.
        * Added a Makefile.PL to the dzil distro so people can more easily
          contribute.

0.50 2014-03-14
        * :Test and :Tests attributes have been added.
        * TAP::Stream is now in its own distribution and thus removed from
          this one.
        * Test::Class::Moose::Role - croak() if preamble doesn't load
          (Sebastian Willert)

0.43 2014-01-29
        * When running parallel tests, we now output a line of dots to the
          screen to show that the test suite hasn't stalled. Further, the dots
          are colored "green" and "red" (sorry color blind folk!) just like
          Test::Harness, so you can see if tests have passed or failed.

0.42 2014-01-15
        * Remove experimental END block causing issues for some test suites.
        * Merge Dave Rolsky's MetaJSON request (thanks, Dave!)
        * Add better github meta info
        * Document recommended test suite instantiation.
        * Document what Test::Class::Moose::Role is for.

0.41 2014-01-13
        * Fix bug where "skip_all" tests would report as failing if
          Sub::Attribute wasn't installed.

0.40 2014-01-12
        * Parallel tests now automatically ignore test methods tagged with
          'noparallel'.
        * Fix bug where sequential tests fail with parallel testing.
        * Remove long-deprecated test_reporting() method.
        * The second argument to test methods ($report) is now deprecated.
          Call $test->test_report instead.
        * You can now call has_tag() on a method report object.

0.30 [unreleased]
        * Experimental support for parallel testing. See
          Test::Class::Moose::Role::Parallel.

0.22 2013-08-17
        * Renamed tutorial from .pod to .pm to stop both cpan and metacpan
          from replacing main documentation with the tutorial.

0.21 2013-08-15
        * Fold on .t test into t/tags.t. Cleaner and stops some CPAN testers
          failures.

0.20 2013-08-15
        * Fix bug #87801 where excluded tags were ANDed instead of ORed.
          Stefan Corneliu Petrea.
        * The beginnings of a tutorial by Doug Bell (preaction)
        * Doc fix by Olaf Alders.
        * Tag inheritance added by Paul Boyd (see
          https://github.com/Ovid/test-class-moose/pull/10). This change is
          slightly backwards-incompatible, but not many people were yet using
          this module (or tags).

0.12 2013-05-27
        * Bugfix: test_classes attribute to constructor is allowed to be
          undef or an empty array ref.
        * add_to_plan() is now deprecated. Use plan() instead. This solves the
          problem where you might also have a before modifier wanting to alter
          the plan.

0.11 2013-05-19
        * Added the test_classes attribute to the contructor. Allows you to
          easily control which classes you wish to run.

0.10 2013-05-08
        * Sigh. Skip All tag tests if we can't define tags.

0.09 2013-05-07
        * Emergency bug fix: don't require Sub::Attribute if they cannot load
          it.

0.08 2013-05-06
        * Add tag support.
        * Clean up how start and end times for timing is handled.

0.07 2013-04-07
        * The $test_suite object now has the time() method.
        * Fully document report methods
        * Marked a bunch of "trusted" methods as effectively private.
        * Rename tests_run() to num_tests_run() (internal consistency)
        * Rename test_reporting() to test_report() (test_reporting() is now
          deprecated)
        * Rename ::Reporting classes to ::Report
        * Allow plans in methods. See #84046 in RT queue (Steffen W)
        * Convert to Dist::Zilla
        * Runtests returns $self.

0.06 2013-03-17
        * Fix the MANIFEST again. That's it. After this I'm switching to
          Dist::Zilla.

0.05 2013-03-17
        * Even if attributes start with test_, they cannot be test methods.
        * Add AutoUse to the MANIFEST :/

0.04 2013-03-17
        * Fix test inheritance bug.

0.03 2013-03-16
        * Add Test::Class::Moose::Role::AutoUse (automatically loads your
          actual classes)

0.02 2013-01-29
        * Add class/method skipping. 
        * Rename almost every overrideable method to /^test_/.
        * Add a time reporting class. You can now fetch real, user and system
          time for each class or test method.
        * Fix for errors when no test methods found (they should be skipped -
          beresfordt)
        * Don't use a bare qw() for parens (reported on github by beresfordt)
        * Make sure we have hi-res time reporting
        * Move statistics gathering into its own classes
        * Add include/exclude test method filtering
        * Skip a test class if we don't find any test methods
        * Most attributes pushed into Test::Class::Moose::Config
        * Added "randomize" attribute per Udo Oji.

0.01 2012-12-18
        * Test::Class + Moose
